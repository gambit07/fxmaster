<hr/>
<p>Welcome to the official release of FXMaster V7.3! Many Particles have seen tweaks and functionality enhancements in V7.3, along with general performance improvements. Particle Effects now scale to the dimensions of a given scene which is a huge improvement to performance. Additionally, Foundrys native Performance modes now have special handling and the total Particle count will be reduced for lower Performance modes to help players on lower end devices. Many effects now also have a Top Down mode toggle, which will play the effects as if viewing them from above. These effects include Rain, Snow, Snowstorm, Autumn Leaves, Bubbles, Embers, and Sakura Bloom! Additionally, all Animal particle effects now have a Directional Movement toggle and a Lateral Movement parameter. Directional Movement allows all animals to move in a specific direction, with an optional spread angle in degrees. Lateral Movement allows animals to move in a sine-wave type pattern for additional randomization and more naturalistic movement. A few functionality improvements have been added as well, including a new API Effects window to control effects created via a Macro, and a new Hide Effects menu to allow hiding effects from the particle and filter effect windows if they're not relevant for your game. Hope everyone enjoys!</p>

**<p>Any support via the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/GambitsLounge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://ko-fi.com/gambit07" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ko-fi</a> is greatly appreciated! If you are a Patreon subscriber you will receive access to the FXMaster+ module. FXMaster+ can be accessed from Patreon, and it's where I will be adding new particle effects and filters moving forward.

FXMaster is a module for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop] that provides various types of effects:

- _Particle Effects_, including weather (rain, clouds, fog, snow, etc.), animals (crows, bats, spiders, etc.), and a few
  others.
- _Filter Effects_, including color overlays, underwater, lightning, and more.
- _Animation Effects_, using video files provided by external sources.

This module also provides ways to easily configure these effects.

## Installation Instructions

To install FXMaster, find FXMaster in the module browser, or paste the following URL into the Install Module dialog in
the Setup menu of Foundry Virtual Tabletop:

```
https://github.com/gambit07/fxmaster/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

## FAQ

- Q: I have put a animation effect onto a scene, and now I can't get rid of it. How do I remove it?

  A: Most likely, you created a permanently playing animation effect by dragging an animation effect onto the canvas, which
  is just a regular [Tile](https://foundryvtt.com/article/tiles/) and not managed by FXMaster. To remove it, go to the
  Tile Controls and remove the Tile there.

- Q: What is the difference between Particle Effects, Filter Effects, and Animation Effects?

  A: Particle Effects are global effects that display particles on the whole scene. Mostly they are weather effects, but
  they also include animals and some other effects.<br>
  Filter Effects are filters that adjust the whole scene in some way, e.g. by adjusting the color or distorting the
  scene to look like it's underwater.<br>
  Animation Effects are animations (video files) that can be played on your chosen location on the canvas.

- Q: Can I provide my own effects?

  A: You can provide your own Animation Effects via the Custom folder in the module's settings.
  It's not possible to provide your own Particle Effects or Filter Effects.

## Usage

The functionality of FXMaster can be accessed via _Effect Controls_ <picture style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:bottom;"><source srcset="./media/font-awesome/wand-magic-sparkles-light.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"> <source srcset="./media/font-awesome/wand-magic-sparkles-dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"> <img src="./media/font-awesome/wand-magic-sparkles-dark.svg" alt="Effect Controls Icon" height="20" width="20" style="vertical-align:middle;"></picture> in scene controls. Each FXMaster app has its own tool inside scene controls.

_Animation Effects_ are video files that can be previewed and/or placed on the canvas via clicking and dragging. FXMaster aggregates animations from popular animation module providers including: [JB2A], [Jinker's Animated Art], [Jack Kerouac's Animated Spell Effects], [Jack Kerouac's Animated Spell Effects Cartoon], [Boss Loot Animated Assets], and [Wild Magic Surge]. Along side the built in module support, you can also add your own Custom folder of animations from the modules settings.

On first world load after updating or installing FXMaster, the animation effects database will be built. You will see an active UI notification window while this process runs. It can take up to 10 minutes depending on how many animations exist in your world. Once the process completes, you are ready to use the Animation Effects window. If you ever add or remove animations, either from a Custom folder or an Animation module, you can re-build the animations database at any time via the Animation Effects window option "Refresh Animations".

Clicking on this tool opens the _Animation Effects Management_ app:

![Animation Effects Management](./media/screenshots/animation-effects-management.webp)

In this app, you can filter based on specific animation providers and search for specific animations. Searching supports advanced queries using AND, OR, and NOT, e.g.: (eldritch OR arrow) AND NOT blast

You can preview each effect by hovering over the black box with your mouse.

#### Placing Animation Effects

In order to place an _Animation Effect_, simply drag it from the window to the canvas which will create a [Tile](https://foundryvtt.com/article/tiles/) on the canvas that includes your animation.

#### Managing Animation Effects

_Animation Effects_ details can be viewed by right clicking an animation icon in the window. Details included are the Author, File Name, File Path, and Sequencer Path. Additionally, you can adjust the Scale and Anchor of a placed tile within this menu. Finally, you can Favorite an animation within this window, which will create a Favorites tag in the main window dropdown. If you make a change, hit the "Save Changes" button to save the _Animation Effect_ and close the app.

### Particle Effects&nbsp;&nbsp;<picture style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:bottom;"><source srcset="./media/font-awesome/cloud-rain-light.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source srcset="./media/font-awesome/cloud-rain-dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"><img src="./media/font-awesome/cloud-rain-dark.svg" alt="" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" height="20" width="20" style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:bottom;"></picture>

_Particle Effects_ include weather effects like rain, fog, clouds, and snow, but also other global particle effects such as birds flying across the scene or spiders crawling around. 

There are two ways to implement _Particle Effects_: via the _Effect Controls_ menu for global _Particle Effects_, or via a [Region](https://foundryvtt.com/article/scene-regions/) using the _FXMaster: Particle Effects_ Region behavior.

#### Particle Effects via Effect Controls App

Clicking on the _Effect Controls_ tool opens the _Particle Effects Management_ app:

![Particle Effects Management](./media/screenshots/particle-effects-management.webp)

In this app, you can configure individual _Particle Effects_. They are sorted into different groups ("Weather", "Ambient", and "Animals").

You can activate individual _Particle Effects_ by clicking the corresponding toggle button.

By clicking on the name of a _Particle Effect_, you expand it, showing the options for that effect:

![Particle Effect Options](./media/screenshots/particle-effect-options.webp)

#### Particle Effects via Region Behavior

After adding a Region, open the Region config menu and navigate to the Behaviors tab. Add a new behavior and select the option 'FXMaster: Particle Effects': 

![Particle Effects Management](./media/screenshots/particle-effects-region-management.webp)

- In this menu, you can configure individual _Particle Effects_ in the same way as in the main app, and add region elevation visibility handling.
  - Selecting the checkbox next to a _Particle Effect_ will display a dropdown of its options.
  - Saving the Region behavior will add the selected _Particle Effects_ to the region.
  - For region elevation, use the **Elevation Constraints** dropdown.

- **Elevation Constraints**
  - **None** — No elevation restrictions are considered.
  - **Tokens POV** — Visibility will be restricted to a given token’s POV.
    - Example: If the region elevation bottom is set to 10 feet and the region elevation top is set to 20 feet, the particle effect will be visible to the token while their elevation is between 10 and 20 feet.
    - Example: If the region elevation bottom is set to 10 feet and the region elevation top is infinite, the particle effect will be visible to the token while their elevation is 10 feet or above.
    - Example: If the region elevation bottom is infinite and the region elevation top is set to 20 feet, the particle effect will be visible to the token while their elevation is 20 feet or below.
  - **Specific Tokens POV** — Same visibility as **Tokens POV**, but only allows visibility for Token UUIDs entered. Any Token UUID not entered will not be able to see the particle effect.
  - **Always Visible for GM** — Ignores **Tokens POV** for GM and makes the effect always visible.

- In addition, you can subscribe the Particle Region behavior to the **Token Enters** and **Token Exits** events.
  - These events can work in concert with the **Elevation Constraints** options, or on their own.

- **Events**
  - **Token Enters** — Effect becomes visible when a token enters the bounds of the region.
    - This event can be paired with **Token Exits** to turn an effect on and off when a token moves in/out.
    - Alternatively, you can only add **Token Enters**; in that case the effect becomes visible once a token enters and remains visible even if they exit.
  - **Token Exits** — Effect becomes not visible when a token exits the bounds of the region.


#### Masking Particle Effects

By default, _Particle Effects_ added via the app are displayed across the entire scene. However, it is possible to mask them from specific areas. This can be achieved within Regions by using the Region behavior "Suppress Weather" or "FXMaster: Suppress Scene Particles". "Suppress Weather" masks all Particle and Filter effects along with core Foundry effects, "FXMaster: Suppress Scene Particles" only masks FXMaster Particle Effects.

- When using "FXMaster: Suppress Scene Particles", there is additional region elevation visibility handling.
- **Elevation Constraints**
  - **None** — No elevation restrictions are considered.
  - **Tokens POV** — Visibility suppression will be restricted to a given token’s POV.
  - **Specific Tokens POV** — Same visibility as **Tokens POV**, but only allows visibility for Token UUIDs entered. Any Token UUID not entered will not be able to see the suppression.
  - **Always Visible for GM** — Ignores **Tokens POV** for GM and makes the suppression always visible.

- In addition, you can subscribe the Particle Region behavior to the **Token Enters** and **Token Exits** events.
  - These events can work in concert with the **Elevation Constraints** options, or on their own.

- **Events**
  - **Token Enters** — Effect becomes suppressed when a token enters the bounds of the region.
    - This event can be paired with **Token Exits** to turn suppression on and off when a token moves in/out.
    - Alternatively, you can only add **Token Enters**; in that case the effect becomes suppressed once a token enters and remains suppressed even if they exit.
  - **Token Exits** — Suppression becomes disabled when a token exits the bounds of the region.

_Particle Effects_ are only displayed outside the region areas when masked. If a Hole shape is added to the region, scene particle effects will display in the hole area cutout.

#### ⚠ Performance Note

The _Particle Effects_ provided by FXMaster have recently had an overhaul for Performance in versions 7.2.0+. I've normalized particle density and added in support for Foundrys built-in Performance Mode client setting. FXMaster will now adjust density based on that setting, where percentage is the fraction of total particles set in the manager that will be emitted, Maximum = 100%, High = 75%, Medium = 50%, Low = 25%. These changes allow much more flexibility for the GM across different player PC configurations and should prevent issues that could occur in the past on very large scenes where maximum density for a given particle effect could crash the scene. If there is an issue where too many particle effects cause a crash, launch the world in safe configuration
and delete the configured _Particle Effects_ for the scene by running the following as a script macro or in the
developer console (F12):

```js
canvas.scene.unsetFlag("fxmaster", "effects");
```

You can then safely reactivate your modules.

### Filter Effects&nbsp;&nbsp;<picture style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:bottom;"><source srcset="./media/font-awesome/filter-light.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source srcset="./media/font-awesome/filter-dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"><img src="./media/font-awesome/filter-dark.svg" alt="" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" height="20" width="20" style="vertical-align:middle;"></picture>

_Filter Effects_ include effects that change the underlying scene visuals in some way like altering the color, displaying an old film effect, or adding underwater displacement.
There are two ways to implement _Filter Effects_: via the _Effect Controls_ menu for global _Filter Effects_, or via a [Region](https://foundryvtt.com/article/scene-regions/) using the _FXMaster: Filter Effects_ Region behavior.

#### Filter Effects via Effect Controls App

Clicking on this tool opens the _Filter Effects Management_ app:

![Filter Effects Management](./media/screenshots/filter-effects-management.webp)

You can activate individual _Filter Effects_ by clicking the corresponding toggle button.

By clicking on the name of a _Filter Effect_, you expand it, showing the options for that effect:

![Filter Effect Options](./media/screenshots/filter-effect-options.webp)

The available options differ heavily between individual _Filter Effects_, so it doesn't make much sense to list them
here.

The options will be adjusted in real-time as you make changes to them.

#### Filter Effects via Region Behavior

After adding a Region, open the Region config menu and navigate to the Behaviors tab. Add a new behavior and select the option 'FXMaster: Filter Effects': 

![Particle Effects Management](./media/screenshots/filter-effects-region-management.webp)

- In this menu, you can configure individual _Filter Effects_ in the same way as in the main app, and add region elevation visibility handling.
  - Selecting the checkbox next to a _Filter Effect_ will display a dropdown of its options.
  - Saving the Region behavior will add the selected _Filter Effects_ to the region.
  - For region elevation, use the **Elevation Constraints** dropdown.

- **Elevation Constraints**
  - **None** — No elevation restrictions are considered.
  - **Tokens POV** — Visibility will be restricted to a given token’s POV.
    - Example: If the region elevation bottom is set to 10 feet and the region elevation top is set to 20 feet, the filter effect will be visible to the token while their elevation is between 10 and 20 feet.
    - Example: If the region elevation bottom is set to 10 feet and the region elevation top is infinite, the filter effect will be visible to the token while their elevation is 10 feet or above.
    - Example: If the region elevation bottom is infinite and the region elevation top is set to 20 feet, the filter effect will be visible to the token while their elevation is 20 feet or below.
  - **Specific Tokens POV** — Same visibility as **Tokens POV**, but only allows visibility for Token UUIDs entered. Any Token UUID not entered will not be able to see the filter effect.
  - **Always Visible for GM** — Ignores **Tokens POV** for GM and makes the effect always visible.

- In addition, you can subscribe the Filter Region behavior to the **Token Enters** and **Token Exits** events.
  - These events can work in concert with the **Elevation Constraints** options, or on their own.

- **Events**
  - **Token Enters** — Effect becomes visible when a token enters the bounds of the region.
    - This event can be paired with **Token Exits** to turn an effect on and off when a token moves in/out.
    - Alternatively, you can only add **Token Enters**; in that case the effect becomes visible once a token enters and remains visible even if they exit.
  - **Token Exits** — Effect becomes not visible when a token exits the bounds of the region.

#### Masking Filter Effects

By default, _Filter Effects_ added via the scene app are displayed across the entire scene. However, it is possible to mask them from specific areas. This can be achieved within Regions by using the Region behavior "Suppress Weather" or "FXMaster: Suppress Scene Filters". "Suppress Weather" masks all Particle and Filter effects along with core Foundry effects, "FXMaster: Suppress Scene Filters" only masks FXMaster Filter Effects.

- When using "FXMaster: Suppress Scene Filters", there is additional region elevation visibility handling.
- **Elevation Constraints**
  - **None** — No elevation restrictions are considered.
  - **Tokens POV** — Suppression will be restricted to a given token’s POV.
  - **Specific Tokens POV** — Same visibility as **Tokens POV**, but only allows visibility for Token UUIDs entered. Any Token UUID not entered will not be able to see the suppression.
  - **Always Visible for GM** — Ignores **Tokens POV** for GM and makes the suppression always visible.

- In addition, you can subscribe the Filter Region behavior to the **Token Enters** and **Token Exits** events.
  - These events can work in concert with the **Elevation Constraints** options, or on their own.

- **Events**
  - **Token Enters** — Suppression becomes visible when a token enters the bounds of the region.
    - This event can be paired with **Token Exits** to turn suppression on and off when a token moves in/out.
    - Alternatively, you can only add **Token Enters**; in that case the suppression becomes visible once a token enters and remains visible even if they exit.
  - **Token Exits** — Suppression becomes disabled when a token exits the bounds of the region.

_Filter Effects_ are only displayed outside the region areas when masked. If a Hole shape is added to the region, scene filter effects will display in the hole area cutout.

### Save Particle and Filter Effects as a Macro&nbsp;&nbsp;<picture style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:bottom;"><source srcset="./media/font-awesome/floppy-disk-light.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source srcset="./media/font-awesome/floppy-disk-dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"><img src="./media/font-awesome/floppy-disk-dark.svg" alt="" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" height="20" width="20" style="vertical-align:middle;"></picture>

This tool allows you to create a macro from the currently active _Particle Effects_ and _Filter Effects_. When clicking
this tool, a macro is created in the macro directory. It's not put onto the hotbar, so you need to drag it there
yourself if you want to.

When executed, the macro sets the _Particle Effects_ and _Filter Effects_ of the current scene to the state they were in
when the macro was created.

### Clear Particle and Filter Effects&nbsp;&nbsp;<picture style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:bottom;"><source srcset="./media/font-awesome/trash-light.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source srcset="./media/font-awesome/trash-dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"><img src="./media/font-awesome/trash-dark.svg" alt="" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" height="20" width="20" style="vertical-align:middle;"></picture>

When clicked, this tool shows a confirmation dialog to delete all _Particle Effects_ and _Filter Effects_ from the
current scene.

## Developer API

FXMaster provides functionality to interact with _Filter Effects_ and _Particle Effects_ from other packages and macros.

### Filter Effects

- Adding or updating a named filter
  ```javascript
  FXMASTER.filters.addFilter("myfilterID", "color", {
    color: { value: "#ff00ff", apply: true },
    gamma: 1.0,
    contrast: 1.0,
    brightness: 1.0,
    saturation: 0.2,
  });
  ```
- Removing a named filter
  ```javascript
  FXMASTER.filters.removeFilter("myfilterID");
  ```
- Toggling a named filter on and off

#### Some Particle Effect Options

| Option       | Type                              | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scale`      | `number`                          | A factor that scales the effect relative to its base size.                                                                          |
| `direction`  | `number`                          | The direction of the effect in degrees.                                                                                             |
| `speed`      | `number`                          | A factor that adjusts the speed of the effect relative to its base speed.                                                           |
| `lieftime`   | `number`                          | A factor that adjusts the lifetime of the individual particles.                                                                     |
| `density`    | `number`                          | The density of the effect. For most effects, it represents the number of particles per grid unit.                                   |
| `alpha`      | `number`                          | A factor between 0 and 1 that adjusts the opacity of the particles (this is called "Opacity" in Particle Effects Management).       |
| `tint`       | `{value: string, apply: boolean}` | Tint the effect with this color.                                                                                                    |
| `animations` | `string[]`                        | An array of animations from list of animations for the effect to use. If it is empty or not defined, the default animation is used. |
